## Kevin M. Gallagher (@ageis) 2019 professional/technical CV

This document is based upon the popular LaTeX template [AltaCV](https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV) with some significant modifications done by myself. 

The résumé plus my personal information is also published at [cointel.pro](https://cointel.pro/resume).

If you want to fork from this, I recmmend opening it as a project in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).

After years of wondering how the publishing and typesetting of textbooks, academic papers and mathematical formulas is done, since no word processor I'd ever used came close in terms of features, style, overwhelming control and absolute flexibility — I used this project and the occasion of my unemployment to finally learn LaTeX. I was highly impressed and will likely be back with more TeX stuff; such as class and style files.
